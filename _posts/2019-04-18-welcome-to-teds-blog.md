Hello everyone, and welcome to my first ever blog post! 

This is my personal blog where I cover Hybrid & Cloud-Only Technologies, focusing specifically on Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 technologies. As a Solutions Architect a Consulting Company thats specializes in Cybersecurity Maturity Model (CMMC) as well as NIST Cyber-Security Framework (NIST 800-171). I leverage these technologies frequently for my clients on their journey to meeting compliance requirements.

The primary goal for this blog is to educate the individuals and organizations on secure cloud based solutions or a hybrid approach when necessary.
